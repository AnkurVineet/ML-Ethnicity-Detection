# ML-Ethnicity-Detection
Establish the Ethnicity/nationality of person by just looking at his facial image, if the image is a group photo then extract image of each individual and then classify.
# Requirements
For performing only prediction directly jump to Step 3.
1. (Preprocessing) UTK Face Dataset - Aligned and cropped faces : https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/ for performing Preprocessing part (Can be skipped)
<br>The output of this step:<br>
a) truncated_X_full.npy is available at:<br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pE16kgV8_qzUTU_py7c_jsaWgN9Sbjvb/view?usp=sharing<br>
b) truncated_Y_full.npy is available at:<br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qUIkfEOVLmnYAlIRoI0ORRLfXcK2qRXn/view?usp=sharing
2. (Training) For training above two files are required the output of this step is: <br>
a) The model which is available at:<br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ov2svebfW2gD_qg-Xzvkjjy-_LoSR3Wx/view?usp=sharing
3. (Prediction) For prediction we need <br>
a) Above trained model available at:<br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ov2svebfW2gD_qg-Xzvkjjy-_LoSR3Wx/view?usp=sharing <br>
b) landmark file available at:<br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPuhpCMK9wkzNopUXrbMmzdo6ZxsQd33/view?usp=sharing <br>
